# Backend Scaffolding Repo (NestJS + Sequelize + Plop)

Hello! 👋  
My name is **Devendar Saiteja Borra**, and I'm an **individual developer**.  
This repository serves as a **backend scaffolding template** built using:

- **NestJS**
- **Sequelize (MySQL)**
- **Plop.js (Code Generator)**

This setup helps you generate new backend modules quickly and consistently using a single command.

## 🚀 Generate New NestJS Modules

This project uses **Plop** to auto-generate:

- Controller  
- Service  
- Module  
- Model  
- DTOs  
- Folder structure  

To generate a new module, simply run:

```bash
yarn plop
```

## Project Setup

```bash
yarn install
```

## Compile and Run the Project

```bash
# development
yarn run start

# watch mode
yarn run start:dev

# production mode
yarn run start:prod
```

## Run Tests
```bash
# unit tests
yarn run test

# e2e tests
yarn run test:e2e

yarn run test:cov
```
